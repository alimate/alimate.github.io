## Kemikit
This repository will serve as my personal blog where I share my, usually, distrubing thoughts on geeky subjects. Currently this blog is based on two other [Jekyll][Jekyll] open source themes. First one is the [Jekyll Resume][Jekyll-Resume] project on which my personal CV is based. [Gravity][Gravity], the other one, is the theme that my blog is based on.

## Contributing
You would always be very welcome to contribute to our blog posts. In addition to the typical fork and pull request scenario, each post has an *Improve this post* edit button: <br>
![Improve this post][Contribution-Image]<br>
By clicking on the edit button, you would be redirected to that post's Github page, where you can edit it more easily. Anyway, if you ever wanted to fix something in a post or improve another a bit, feel free to contribute. I would be very honored!
