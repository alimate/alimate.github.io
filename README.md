# Kemikit
This repository will serve as my personal blog where I share my, usually, distrubing thoughts on geeky subjects. Currently this blog is based on two other [Jekyll][1] open source themes. First one is the [Jekyll Resume][2] project on which my personal CV is based. [Gravity][3], the other one, is the theme that my blog is based on.
